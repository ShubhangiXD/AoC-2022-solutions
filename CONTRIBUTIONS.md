# Contributions

While this repository is something that should have been made in the month of December, it's never too late to solve code. 
I prefer to solve the questions myself but here are a few ways you can contribute if you're looking to learn about how to contribute in open source projects.

## Areas of Improvement

* You can add _Documentation_ wherever you feel necessary, or help in updating the contents page and clean up the raw documentations. 
* You can add _Code_ in a different language. Even though I did not set up different folders, you are welcome to add them following the sequence AOC_2022_(proglang).
* You can _edit existing code_ by adding comments wherever required or improve efficiency of the code. But I will be rejecting mass PR's in this context.

## How to make a Pull Request (PR)?

These are the 4 steps to make a PR.<br>
\- Fork - Clone - Edit - Push - 

### Forking:
Beside the repository name, find the button that says 'Fork'.

Create a fork, keep everything intact. You can rename your repo to say something like (repository_name)copy to distinguish it from your own repositories.

### Cloning:
When you're done, go to the repository and click on code and copy the URL.

Now, there are multiple ways to clone a directory and make a PR. You can edit the code (especially if you're documenting or commenting) directly from the 
website and create a _new branch_ and make a PR.

Otherwise, to code, there are 2 ways to go about it. Either through terminal, or through GITHUB Desktop.

TERMINAL:<br>
Remember the URL you copied? Open Git Bash and type this: <br>
`$ git clone URL_you_copied` <br>
Press enter to create your clone!<br>

GITHUB DESKTOP (you should have it installed): <br>
Just add the repository to your client:

Select a path where you want your repository to be in and click create. Then you can open your repository in VSCode or whichever IDE you code in!
